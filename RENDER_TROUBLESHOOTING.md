# 🚨 RENDER DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING

## ❌ What's Going Wrong:
You're trying to deploy the FRONTEND but Render is looking in the SERVER directory!

## ✅ CORRECT APPROACH - Deploy These Separately:

---

## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT #1: API SERVER (Do This First)

### Step 1: Create Web Service for API
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"** (NOT Static Site)
3. Connect repository: **Safe-Edu**

### Step 2: Configure API Settings
```
Service Name: disaster-management-api
Root Directory: server          ← THIS IS KEY!
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
Environment Variables:
- NODE_ENV=production  
- PORT=10000
```

### Step 3: Deploy API & Get URL
- Deploy and wait for success
- Copy your API URL (like: `https://disaster-management-api.onrender.com`)

---

## 🌐 DEPLOYMENT #2: FRONTEND WEBSITE (Do This Second)

### Step 1: Create Static Site for Frontend
1. In Render Dashboard, click **"New +"** → **"Static Site"** (NOT Web Service)
2. Connect same repository: **Safe-Edu**

### Step 2: Configure Frontend Settings
```
Site Name: disaster-management-frontend
Root Directory: (LEAVE COMPLETELY EMPTY!)  ← NOT "server"!
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
Environment Variables:
- VITE_EMERGENCY_API_URL=https://your-actual-api-url.onrender.com/api/emergency-contacts
```

---

## 🎯 KEY DIFFERENCES:

### API Deployment (Web Service):
- ✅ **Type**: Web Service  
- ✅ **Root Directory**: `server`
- ✅ **Purpose**: Runs your Node.js API
- ✅ **Output**: API endpoints

### Frontend Deployment (Static Site):
- ✅ **Type**: Static Site
- ✅ **Root Directory**: (EMPTY!)
- ✅ **Purpose**: Builds and serves your React app
- ✅ **Output**: Static files in `dist/` folder

---

## 🚨 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:

1. **DELETE** your current failed deployment
2. **Start over** with **Web Service** for API first
3. **Then create separate Static Site** for frontend

The error happens because you're mixing up the two deployments!

---

**🔥 The dist folder error means you're trying to deploy frontend from the server directory - that's wrong!**
